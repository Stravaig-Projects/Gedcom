> **Lapidary** (from the Latin _lapidarius_) is the practice of shaping stone, minerals, or gemstones into decorative items such as cabochons, engraved gems (including cameos), and faceted designs. A person who practices lapidary is known as a _lapidarist_. A lapidarist uses the lapidary techniques of cutting, grinding, and polishing.
